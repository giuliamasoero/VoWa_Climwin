# Introduction on the package climwin

"climwin is a package in R to help users detect a time period or ‘window’ over which a response variable (usually biological) is sensitive to the environment (usually climate/weather). Periods of climate sensitivity can help inform experimental design, improve species modelling or allow users to more effectively account for climate in statistical modelling. This vignette will give an introduction to the package and its basic features. The advanced vignette provides more detail on the ‘advanced’ features present within the package." (From the R Help ??climwin)

In this repository, I have prepared some code to try climwin using data on wing length, sternum lenght and body mass of Alpine swift nestlings meastured at 50 days.
